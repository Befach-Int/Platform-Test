### MCP Servers (5 Active, 6 from Week 4)

- ✅ **Supabase MCP** - Documentation search, schema introspection, migrations, RLS, real-time
- ✅ **Playwright MCP** - E2E testing, browser automation, screenshots
- ✅ **Vercel MCP** - Deployment management, environment variables, build monitoring
- ✅ **Parallel Search MCP** - Multi-source web search (Tavily, Perplexity, Exa, Brave) for AI research
- ✅ **Parallel Task MCP** - Task orchestration, automation, multi-agent workflows
- ⏳ **shadcn/ui MCP** - *(Install Week 4+)* Component installation, multi-registry access, AI-assisted UI development

**Note**: Parallel.ai MCPs provide advanced search and task automation capabilities.
**API Key Required**: Configure at https://platform.parallel.ai

**shadcn/ui MCP Note**: Install at the start of Week 4 when UI-heavy development begins (Feature Planning, Review, Analytics modules). Adds ~2-3k tokens but provides significant value for component-heavy modules. See Week 4 Pre-Setup below.

### Development Server Policy

**IMPORTANT**: Always run the Next.js dev server on **localhost:3000** only.

```bash
# Before starting dev server, kill any existing Node processes:
taskkill /F /IM node.exe 2>nul

# Then start the server (it will use port 3000):
cd next-app && npm run dev
```

**Rules:**
- ✅ Only ONE dev server instance on port 3000
- ❌ NEVER run on other ports (3001, 3002, etc.)
- ❌ If port 3000 is occupied, kill the process first
- ✅ Always check for and terminate duplicate instances

## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES

### Multi-Tenant System
- **Team Isolation**: All tables have `team_id` for data separation
- **Row-Level Security**: RLS policies enforce access control
- **ID Format**: Timestamp-based TEXT IDs (`Date.now().toString()`) - NEVER use UUID
- **Workspace = Project**: Each workspace is a separate product/project

### Database Schema (Supabase)

#### Core Tables
```
users           - User accounts (Supabase Auth)
teams           - Organizations/teams
team_members    - Team membership and roles
subscriptions   - Stripe billing data
workspaces      - Projects with phase and modules
```

#### Feature Tables
```
features        - Top-level roadmap items
timeline_items  - MVP/SHORT/LONG breakdowns
linked_items    - Dependencies and relationships
```

#### Mind Mapping Tables
```
mind_maps       - Canvas data (ReactFlow JSON)
mind_map_nodes  - Individual nodes (5 types)
mind_map_edges  - Connections between nodes
```

#### Review & Feedback Tables
```
review_links    - Public/invite/iframe links
feedback        - Reviewer submissions
```

#### Analytics Tables
```
custom_dashboards - User-created dashboards
success_metrics   - Expected vs actual tracking
ai_usage          - Message count per user/month
```

### Data Sync Strategy
1. **Write**: Save to Supabase immediately (no localStorage)
2. **Read**: Load from Supabase, cache in React Query
3. **Real-time**: Subscribe to Supabase Realtime for live updates
4. **Conflict resolution**: Last write wins (timestamp-based)

---

## 💻 CODING STANDARDS

### Core Principles

✅ **DO**:
- Use strict TypeScript (interfaces, no `any`)
- Use `Date.now().toString()` for IDs (NEVER UUID)
- Always filter by `team_id` for multi-tenancy
- Handle errors explicitly
- Use shadcn/ui components + Tailwind CSS
- Enable RLS on all tables

❌ **DON'T**:
- Use `any` type
- Skip `team_id` filtering
- Use inline styles or custom CSS
- Use UUID for IDs
- Skip error handling

### Quick Examples

**TypeScript**: Strict interfaces, timestamp IDs, error handling
**Components**: shadcn/ui + Tailwind, TypeScript props
**Queries**: Team-scoped, typed responses, explicit errors

**Full Patterns**: See [Code Patterns Reference](docs/reference/CODE_PATTERNS.md) for:
- Complete TypeScript examples
- Next.js component patterns (Server & Client)
- Supabase query patterns
- Database migration examples
- Real-time subscription patterns
- Feature gates & billing
- AI integration patterns

## 🤖 CLAUDE AGENTS BY PHASE

### Week 1-2: Foundation
```
✅ frontend-developer   - Next.js setup, auth pages, layouts
✅ typescript-pro       - Type definitions, Supabase types
✅ database-architect   - Multi-tenant schema, RLS policies
✅ security-engineer    - Auth implementation, JWT validation, API protection
✅ devops-engineer      - CI/CD pipeline, Vercel configuration
```

### Week 3: Mind Mapping (CRITICAL)
```
✅ frontend-developer   - ReactFlow canvas, custom nodes
✅ typescript-pro       - Node types, canvas state
```

### Week 4: Feature Planning & Dependencies

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Before starting Week 4, install shadcn/ui MCP**

Week 4 begins UI-heavy development (Feature Planning forms, dependency graphs, dialogs). The shadcn/ui MCP provides significant value for component-heavy modules.

**Pre-Week 4 Setup Checklist:**
- [ ] Install shadcn/ui MCP by adding to `cursor-mcp-config.json`
- [ ] Verify MCP connection (restart Claude Code if needed)
- [ ] Test with prompt: "List available shadcn components"

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shadcn-ui": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@jpisnice/shadcn-ui-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Why Now?**
- Feature Planning module requires extensive forms, tables, dialogs
- Dependency Management needs complex UI components
- AI-assisted component selection saves development time
- Multi-registry support (Aceternity UI, Magic UI) for advanced components

**Token Impact:** +2-3k tokens (~30% increase on MCP usage, acceptable given 22.3k freed)

**See Also:** [MCP_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md](MCP_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md) for context on MCP strategy

## 🔄 TRACKING POSTPONED FEATURES

When features are planned but postponed, follow a structured process to ensure they're tracked and resumed at the right time.

### Process Overview

1. **Document immediately**: Create spec in `docs/postponed/[FEATURE_NAME].md`
2. **Add tracking entry**: Update `docs/implementation/postponed-features.md`
3. **Include required fields**: What, When, Why, Dependencies, Priority, Review Trigger
4. **Review regularly**: End of each phase, when dependencies complete, or when gaps emerge

### Required Information

Every postponed feature must include:
- **What was postponed** + link to detailed spec
- **Postponed date** and **reason** (specific blocking dependencies)
- **Dependencies** (with checkboxes: ✅ done / ⏳ pending)
- **Priority**, **estimated effort**, **when to implement**
- **Review trigger** (when to revisit decision)
- **Rationale** (why waiting is better than implementing now)

### Example: Mind Map Enhancements

**What**: 23 enhancements (auto-zoom, context menus, AI integration)
**Why Postponed**: Needs dependency graph (Week 4), timeline data (Week 6), AI assistant (Week 7)
**When**: After Week 7 completion

**Full Process**: See [Postponed Features Process](docs/processes/POSTPONED_FEATURES_PROCESS.md) for:
- Entry format template
- Review cadence and triggers
- Detailed examples and best practices

**Tracking**: [docs/implementation/postponed-features.md](docs/implementation/postponed-features.md)

---

## ✅ EXECUTION TIMING & DEPENDENCY CROSS-CHECKS

Before implementing ANY feature, validate that it's the right time to build it. Implementing too early causes rework, incomplete features, poor UX, and wasted development time.

### The 5-Question Framework

Ask these questions BEFORE starting:

1. **Data Dependencies**: Do required data sources, tables, or APIs exist and are they stable?
2. **Integration Points**: Are module APIs defined and stable? Any breaking changes expected?
3. **User Experience**: Are prerequisite features built? Does this provide standalone value?
4. **Database Schema**: Are required tables/columns finalized? Any cross-module impacts?
5. **Testing Feasibility**: Can this be fully tested with available data?

### Quick Decision Guide

| All Checks Pass | Some Checks Fail | Many Checks Fail |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------|
| ✅ **PROCEED NOW** | ⚠️ **PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION** | ❌ **POSTPONE** |
| Full implementation | Build foundation, enhance later | Document in [postponed features](docs/implementation/postponed-features.md) |

### Validation Workflow

```
Before implementing:
  → Run 5-Question Framework
  → All YES? ✅ PROCEED
  → Any NO? ⏸️ POSTPONE & document blocking dependencies
```

**Full Details**: See [Implementation Timing Checklist](docs/processes/IMPLEMENTATION_TIMING_CHECKLIST.md) for:
- Detailed 5-question framework with examples
- Pre-implementation checklist template
- Decision examples (good vs. bad timing)
- When to re-evaluate postponed features

**Remember**: It's better to postpone and build correctly than to implement early and rework later!

## 📅 WEEKLY PROGRESSION TRACKING

### Critical Rule: Never Move On Without Documenting

**Every significant change MUST be documented in the current week's progression file** (`docs/implementation/week-X-Y.md`). This prevents lost context, forgotten dependencies, and broken feature links.

### When to Update Weekly Files

Update the current week file **immediately after**:
- ✅ Feature completion or major milestone
- ✅ Architecture changes or new patterns introduced
- ✅ Database schema modifications
- ✅ Dependency changes (satisfied or newly created)
- ✅ Postponed features or deferred work
- ✅ Blockers encountered or resolved
- ✅ Progress percentage changes (e.g., 50% → 75%)

### What to Document in Weekly Files

Each significant change should include:

1. **What Changed**: Specific features, files, or components modified
2. **Why**: Rationale for decisions made
3. **Progress Update**: New completion percentage for the week
4. **Dependencies**:
   - ✅ Dependencies satisfied (from previous weeks)
   - ⏳ New dependencies created (for future weeks)
5. **Files Modified/Created**: List of changed files with brief descriptions
6. **Future Impact**: Which future weeks are affected by this change
7. **Cross-References**: Links to related docs (postponed features, architecture, etc.)

### Required Cross-Linking

**Link to Related Weeks**:
- If satisfying dependency → Link to week that created it
- If creating dependency → Link to future week that needs it
- If postponing feature → Link to target week for implementation

**Link to Related Docs**:
- Postponed features → `docs/postponed/[FEATURE_NAME].md`
- Architecture changes → `docs/reference/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- API changes → `docs/reference/API_REFERENCE.md`
- Database changes → `docs/reference/CHANGELOG.md`

### Standard Weekly Entry Format

```markdown
---
### ✅ [Feature Name] (YYYY-MM-DD)

**What Changed**:
- [Bullet points describing what was built/modified]
- [Include component names, route changes, etc.]

**Why**:
- [Rationale for approach taken]
- [Alternative approaches considered]

**Progress**: Week X: [old%] → [new%]

**Dependencies Satisfied**:
- ✅ [Dependency from Week Y] - [Brief description]
- ✅ [Dependency from Week Z] - [Brief description]

**New Dependencies Created**:
- ⏳ [Dependency for Week A] - [What needs this]
- ⏳ [Postponed to Week B] - [Why postponed]

**Files Modified**:
- `path/to/file.tsx` - [What changed]
- Created: `path/to/new-file.tsx` - [Purpose]
- Deleted: `path/to/old-file.tsx` - [Reason]

**Future Impact**:
- Week A: [How this affects future work]
- Week B: [Dependencies or considerations]
- See: [Link to postponed feature doc]

**Links**:
- Related Feature: [docs/implementation/week-Y-Z.md](week-Y-Z.md#feature-name)

```

### Example: Workspace Redesign Entry

```markdown
---
### ✅ Workspace Dashboard Redesign (2025-01-15)

**What Changed**:
- Redesigned workspace page with Supabase-style sidebar navigation
- Added multi-phase horizontal progress bar with auto-calculation
- Implemented research-backed color palette (Indigo → Violet → Emerald → Amber → Green)
- Created phase calculation logic from work item states

**Why**:
- Grid layout provided poor workflow guidance
- Vertical timeline didn't show resource distribution
- Users needed clear visual hierarchy and reduced cognitive load
- Research showed sidebar navigation scales better for 5+ modules

**Progress**: Week 3: 50% → 75% (major UI overhaul completed)

**Dependencies Satisfied**:
- ✅ Work items schema with status fields (Week 2)
- ✅ Workspace module system (Week 1)
- ✅ Team subscription plan field (Week 1)

**New Dependencies Created**:
- ⏳ Focus Mode widget - Postponed to Week 7 (needs AI insights)
- ⏳ Health Alerts component - Postponed to Week 7 (needs analytics)
- ⏳ Auto-assign reviewers - Postponed to Week 7 (needs AI + team data)

**Files Modified**:
- `app/(dashboard)/workspaces/[id]/page.tsx` - Complete layout redesign
- Created: `components/workspaces/workspace-sidebar.tsx` - Collapsible navigation
- Created: `components/workspaces/multi-phase-progress-bar.tsx` - Horizontal progress
- Created: `lib/constants/workspace-phases.ts` - Phase config + calculation
- `cursor-mcp-config.json` - Re-enabled Parallel MCPs

**Future Impact**:
- Week 4: Dependencies module can use phase color system
- Week 5: Review module can filter by phase
- Week 6: Timeline can show phase-based swimlanes
- Week 7: AI insights can analyze phase distribution and suggest optimizations
- See: `docs/postponed/WORKSPACE_ENHANCEMENTS.md` for deferred features

**Links**:
- Postponed Features: [docs/postponed/WORKSPACE_ENHANCEMENTS.md](../postponed/WORKSPACE_ENHANCEMENTS.md)
- Architecture Update: [docs/reference/ARCHITECTURE.md](../reference/ARCHITECTURE.md#workspace-phase-system)
- Color Research: [WORKSPACE_REDESIGN_SUMMARY.md](../../WORKSPACE_REDESIGN_SUMMARY.md)
---
```

### Update Triggers Checklist (Enhanced)

When making ANY significant change, update:

```markdown
- [ ] Current week file: docs/implementation/week-X-Y.md
- [ ] Progress percentage updated in week file
- [ ] Dependencies documented (satisfied + newly created)
- [ ] Future week files updated if new dependencies added
- [ ] Postponed features linked if work deferred
- [ ] Cross-references added to related weeks
- [ ] Files modified/created listed with purposes
- [ ] Future impact documented for affected weeks
- [ ] Related docs updated (Architecture, API, etc.)
- [ ] PROGRESS.md updated with new percentages
```

### Red Flags - Never Do This

❌ **DON'T**:
- Skip documenting changes because "it's small"
- Move to next feature without updating current week file
- Create dependencies without documenting in both weeks (creator + consumer)
- Postpone features without linking to target week
- Forget to update progress percentages
- Break cross-reference links between weeks

✅ **DO**:
- Document every significant change immediately
- Link forward (future weeks) and backward (past weeks)
- Update postponed feature docs with target week
- Keep progress percentages current
- Maintain complete file modification lists
- Cross-reference all related documentation

## 🎨 UI/UX PATTERNS

### shadcn/ui Components
Use pre-built components from shadcn/ui library:

```bash
# Install components as needed
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
npx shadcn-ui@latest add card
npx shadcn-ui@latest add dialog
npx shadcn-ui@latest add dropdown-menu
npx shadcn-ui@latest add form
npx shadcn-ui@latest add input
npx shadcn-ui@latest add select
npx shadcn-ui@latest add table
npx shadcn-ui@latest add tabs
npx shadcn-ui@latest add toast
```

### Tailwind CSS Patterns

```tsx
// ✅ Responsive, mobile-first
<div className="
  grid grid-cols-1 gap-4
  md:grid-cols-2 md:gap-6
  lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-8
">
  {features.map(feature => <FeatureCard key={feature.id} feature={feature} />)}
</div>

// ✅ Flexbox utilities
<div className="flex items-center justify-between gap-4">
  <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">Features</h1>
  <Button>Add Feature</Button>
</div>

// ❌ Avoid inline styles
<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '1rem' }}>
```

4. Generate types: `npx supabase gen types typescript > lib/supabase/types.ts`

**Real-time**: Use `supabase.channel()` with team_id filter, return unsubscribe function

**Feature Gates**: Check team plan, show upgrade modal for Pro features

**E2E Testing**: Playwright with `test.describe()`, test user flows end-to-end

**Full Patterns**: See [Code Patterns Reference](docs/reference/CODE_PATTERNS.md) for complete examples of:
- Database migrations with RLS
- Real-time subscriptions
- Feature gates (Free vs Pro)
- AI chat with streaming
- AI tool calling (agentic mode)
- Playwright E2E testing

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT REMINDERS

### Always Remember
- ✅ Use timestamp-based IDs (`Date.now().toString()`), NEVER UUID
- ✅ Filter all queries by `team_id` for multi-tenancy
- ✅ Enable RLS on all tables
- ✅ Use TypeScript strict mode, avoid `any`
- ✅ Use shadcn/ui components, not custom UI libraries
- ✅ Test on mobile (mobile-first design)
- ✅ Check Pro tier feature gates before accessing features

### Never Do
- ❌ Don't use UUID for IDs
- ❌ Don't skip RLS policies
- ❌ Don't use `any` type in TypeScript
- ❌ Don't create custom CSS files (use Tailwind)
- ❌ Don't hardcode API keys in code
- ❌ Don't skip team_id filtering in queries
