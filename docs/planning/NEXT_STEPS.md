## Phase System (4-Phase)

Work items use type-specific phases:

| Type | Phases |
|------|--------|
| **Feature** | design → build → refine → launch |
| **Concept** | ideation → research → validated/rejected |
| **Bug** | triage → investigating → fixing → verified |

**Key**: Phase IS the status (no separate fields).
