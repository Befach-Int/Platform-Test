2. Identifies 2-3 valuable knowledge points (preferences, decisions, requirements, tech stack, architectural choices, etc.)
3. Shows a toast notification when analysis starts and completes
4. Displays suggestions in a notification bar at the top of the chat
5. You review and approve/reject each suggestion
6. Approved items are added to permanent memory
7. Memory is included in every AI conversation's context (shown in the memory context indicator above chat input)
8. Memory persists across conversations (even after starting new chats) - the AI remembers important information from previous conversations

**Example Questions:**
```
"What MVP features do I have?"
"Show me all Easy difficulty features"
"Suggest a USP for my authentication feature"
"What should I prioritize next?"
"Summarize all SHORT term features"
"Which features have the 'security' tag?"
"How many features are in progress?"
"Show me a comparison table of my features by difficulty"
```

**Table Rendering:**

### Export Data

Click **"📥 Export CSV"** to download your roadmap as a CSV file. The export creates one row per timeline item, making it perfect for Excel analysis, sharing with your team, or importing into other tools!

## 🛠️ Features Overview

### Feature-Level Fields
| Field | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | The name of your feature or service |
| **Type** | Feature or Service |
| **Purpose** | The purpose or goal of this feature/service |

### Timeline Breakdown Items
Each feature must have at least one timeline item. Multiple items allow you to break down implementation phases:

| Field | Description |

| **Timeline** | MVP (critical), SHORT (near term), LONG (future) |
| **Difficulty** | Easy, Medium, or Hard to implement in this phase |
| **USP** | Unique Selling Point - what makes it special in this phase |
| **Integration Type** | How you plan to execute/integrate this in this phase |
| **Categories** | Phase-specific categories (e.g., "backend", "frontend", "mobile") |

### AI-Generated Summaries
When you save a feature with multiple timeline items, AI automatically generates:
- **Combined USP** - Coherent summary showing how USPs progress across phases
- **Combined Integration Type** - Summary of all integration approaches

**Example:** A "User Authentication" feature might have:
- MVP timeline item: Basic login/signup (Easy, Backend, API)
- SHORT timeline item: Social login integration (Medium, Backend + Frontend, OAuth)
- LONG timeline item: Biometric authentication (Hard, Mobile, Biometric SDK)

AI Summary might produce:
- **USP**: "Starts with basic authentication, evolves to include social login, and advances to biometric security"
- **Integration**: "API-based auth expanding to OAuth integration and biometric SDKs"

## 💡 Tips

1. **Break Down Features by Timeline** - Use timeline breakdown to plan features in phases (MVP → SHORT → LONG) with specific details for each phase
2. **AI Summaries** - AI automatically generates concise summaries when you save features with multiple timeline items
3. **Vertical Layout** - Timeline and difficulty badges stack vertically in the table for clear visual mapping
4. **Categories Only in Timeline Items** - Add categories to individual timeline items (e.g., "backend" for MVP, "frontend" for SHORT) - they automatically appear in the main feature row
5. **Leverage AI** - Ask the AI assistant to help you write USPs, prioritize features, or suggest timeline breakdowns
6. **Export Often** - Regularly export your data as a backup - CSV exports one row per timeline item for easy Excel analysis
7. **Filter Smartly** - Timeline and difficulty filters show features if ANY timeline item matches
8. **Search Everything** - Search box searches across all fields including timeline item details and AI-generated summaries
9. **API Key Required for Summaries** - Configure your OpenRouter API key to enable AI summarization (works with chat assistant)
10. **Formatted AI Responses** - AI responses automatically format with bullet points, bold text, code blocks, tables, and proper spacing
11. **Ask for Tables** - Request the AI to show data in table format (e.g., "Show me a comparison table of features")
12. **Use Custom Instructions** - Set up custom instructions to define how the AI should behave (your role, project context, style)
13. **Build Memory Over Time** - Add important decisions, preferences, and context to memory for future conversations
14. **Review Auto-Suggestions** - Check memory suggestions every 5 messages to build your AI's permanent memory
15. **Memory Context Indicator** - Watch the indicator above chat input to see how many memory items are included in your conversation context
16. **Start New When Needed** - Use the 🔄 button to start fresh conversations while keeping your memory intact

## 🔒 Privacy & Data

- **All data is stored locally** in your browser's localStorage
- **No server or database** required
- **Your API key** is stored locally and never shared
- **Export your data** anytime to keep backups

## 💾 Data Persistence & Backup

### Important: File Path Matters!

When using `file://` protocol (opening HTML directly), **each file path gets separate storage**:

```
✅ GOOD: Always open from same location
C:\Users\harsh\Downloads\Platform Test\index.html

❌ BAD: Opening from different paths loses data
C:\Users\harsh\Desktop\index.html  ← Different storage!
C:\Users\harsh\Documents\index.html  ← Different storage!
```

### Backup & Restore Feature

**💾 Backup All** - Export everything to JSON file:
- All features
- Memory items
- Memory suggestions
- Custom instructions
- AI model preferences

**📂 Import Backup** - Restore from JSON backup:
- Select your backup file
- Confirms before overwriting current data
- Restores everything instantly

### When to Use Backup/Restore

1. **Before moving the file** - Export before changing location
2. **Regular backups** - Export weekly to avoid data loss
3. **Switching browsers** - Export from one, import to another
4. **After warnings** - If you see origin change warning
5. **Sharing data** - Send backup to teammates

### Better Solution: Use a Local Server

For more reliable data persistence, run a local web server:

**Option 1: Python (if installed)**
```bash
cd "C:\Users\harsh\Downloads\Platform Test"
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then open: `http://localhost:8000`

**Option 2: VS Code Live Server**
1. Install "Live Server" extension
2. Right-click `index.html`
3. Select "Open with Live Server"

**Option 3: Node.js http-server**
```bash
npx http-server
```

**Benefits of using local server:**
- ✅ Consistent storage location (always `localhost`)
- ✅ No path-based storage issues
- ✅ Better for development
- ✅ More reliable

## 🎨 Customization

Since this is a single HTML file, you can easily customize:

1. **Colors** - Edit the CSS gradient colors in the `<style>` section
2. **Categories** - Change MVP/SHORT/LONG to your own categories
3. **Difficulty Levels** - Modify Easy/Medium/Hard to your scale
4. **AI Models** - Add more models to the dropdown (see section below)

### Changing the AI Model

Simply use the dropdown in the AI chat panel! The app includes 5 cost-effective models:

- **DeepSeek V3.1 Terminus** - 671B params, extremely cost-effective (default)
- **Claude Haiku 4.5** - Anthropic's fastest model
- **GPT-4o Mini** - OpenAI's efficient model
- **Kimi K2** - 1T params with 256K context window
- **Grok 4 Fast** - xAI's model with 2M context window

All models are optimized for speed and cost-effectiveness, perfect for frequent use.

To add more models, edit the `<select id="modelSelect">` section in the HTML and add new `<option>` tags with the model ID from [OpenRouter's model list](https://openrouter.ai/models).
