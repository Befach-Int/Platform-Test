# SonarCloud Query Command

Pull code quality data from SonarCloud. Requires `SONARCLOUD_TOKEN` environment variable.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` - Query type and parameters

## Query Types

| Query | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `issues <project>` | Get open issues | `/sonarcloud issues my-project` |
| `metrics <project>` | Get code metrics | `/sonarcloud metrics my-project` |
| `gate <project>` | Quality gate status | `/sonarcloud gate my-project` |
| `health <project>` | Full health report | `/sonarcloud health my-project` |
| `pr <project> <pr#>` | PR analysis | `/sonarcloud pr my-project 123` |
| `hotspots <project>` | Security hotspots | `/sonarcloud hotspots my-project` |
| `history <project>` | Analysis history | `/sonarcloud history my-project` |

## Filters (append to query)

| Filter | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--branch <name>` | Filter by branch | `--branch develop` |
| `--severity <levels>` | Filter severity | `--severity BLOCKER,CRITICAL` |
| `--type <types>` | Filter issue type | `--type BUG,VULNERABILITY` |
| `--new-code` | Only new code issues | `--new-code` |

## Instructions

<steps>

1. Parse the query from `$ARGUMENTS` to determine:
   - Query type (issues, metrics, gate, health, pr, hotspots, history)
   - Project key
   - Optional filters (branch, severity, type, new-code, etc.)
2. Check for `SONARCLOUD_TOKEN` environment variable. If not set, inform user.
3. Check for `SONARCLOUD_ORG` environment variable or ask user for organization key.
4. Execute the appropriate API call using curl or the TypeScript client at `next-app/src/lib/integrations/sonarcloud.ts`
5. Format and present results clearly:
   - For issues: Group by severity/type, show file, line, message
   - For metrics: Show as table with metric name and value
   - For quality gate: Show pass/fail with failed conditions
   - For health: Comprehensive summary with all data
6. Offer follow-up actions:
   - "Show issues in specific file?"
   - "Get more details on a specific issue?"
   - "Compare with another branch?"

</steps>
